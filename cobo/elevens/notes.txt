QCC:
0. What exactly is <>? What does it indicate? Why do we need them?
 For reference: ArrayList<Card>()

1. Remember to initialize! One of our errors was that we did not initialize
cards in Deck.java

2. We had to rename the array names of ranks, suits, and pointValues in
DeckTester for each deck. If we wanted to keep the same variable names, we would
have to set each element of the array to its updated value. Why is this the case?
