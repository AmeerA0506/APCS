HW65 -- How Many Queens Can a Thinker Place, If a Thinker Can Place Queens...
2022-02-16w
time spent: 1.0 hrs

DISCO:
Due to the nature of queens, the first possible solution would be a 4 by 4. This makes sense because a queen in the left corner covers a 3 by 3 radius, with the first gap being in 4 by 4.
