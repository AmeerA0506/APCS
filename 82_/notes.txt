HW 82 -- Roll Your Own Iterator
2022-03-25
time spent: 0.5 hrs

DISCO
- FOREACH utilizes a pattern of hasNext() and next() to iterate through the list
which means that the _dummy cannot be at the head node or else it won't process
the first element [index 0].

QCC
- We used conditionals to ensure that the first element is being iterated
through the FOREACH method. Is there a cleaner way to do so?
