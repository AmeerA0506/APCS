APCS pd06HW 91: DEQUE THE HALLS
2022-04-13
time spent: 0.7 hrs

DISCO
- LinkedList is doubly-linked so all of the functionality
of Deque methods can directly refer to methods already in
LinkedList
- ArrayList has add() and remove() methods that allow the
input of an index, so we can use that to our advantage in
deciding which end to remove and which end to add.

QCC
- Should the add methods be of type void or boolean?
- Is there any difference between Deque and LinkedList?
