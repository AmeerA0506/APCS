DISCO
* We originally thought this was a sorting algorithm. It is not. The numbers within
the partitions are not sorted. It merely groups numbers by size relative to c.
*This algorithm looks really similar to quickSort. (Ameer pointed this out in class.)
* QCC
* Why does this algorithm stop working after c > 2?
* q0: What does it do?
* a0: It creates a partition at c, where every number to the left of c will be less than c,
and every number to the right will be greater.
*
* q1: Time Complexity?
* a1: Runtime will be o(n) because there is only one for loop, meaning that the runtime (outcome) will be linear to the input.
