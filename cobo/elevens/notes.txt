L07: But These Go Up To Eleven
2022-03-21m
time spent: 3.0 hrs

activity two:
cards are a class referenced by the constructor of decks, without cards you cant have decks.

3 cards

ranks is a string array of "two" to "Ace"
suits is a string array of the 4 suits
pointValues is 2-10 for the nonface cards, 10 for facecards, and 11 for ace

rank and pointvalues matters, not suits

activity 3:
1)  public static String flip() {
      int rand = (int)(Math.random() * 11);
      if (rand<3){
       return "tails";
       }
      else {
      return "heads";
      }
    }
DISCO:
If we have a toString implemented, we can do System.out.println(object) and the toString will be return

We can add multiple variables in a for loop per piazza

we can simplify our ssh into the lab

The swap method isnt in the ArrayList
QCC:
0. What exactly is <>? What does it indicate? Why do we need them?
 For reference: ArrayList<Card>()

1. Remember to initialize! One of our errors was that we did not initialize
cards in Deck.java
cards in Deck.java, and we spent a good chunk of time doing so

2. We had to rename the array names of ranks, suits, and pointValues in
DeckTester for each deck. If we wanted to keep the same variable names, we would
have to set each element of the array to its updated value. Why is this the case?
