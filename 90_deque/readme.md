## To-Do List (Reference to Queue methods)

- size()
    - For convenience
    - Returns value of the List.size()
- addLast(x)
    - Same as enqueue(x)
- removeFirst()
    - Same as dequeue()
- peekFirst()
    - Same as peekFront()
- isEmpty()
    - Same as isEmpty()
- addFirst()
- removeLast()
- peekLast()


## Design Decisions

- Due to piazza traffic, we realzied that LinkedList and Deque have very similar functionality, so using LinkedList as our implementation would help us pass through methods.
- There were also other methods mentioned inside of the implementation of Deque according to Java API, but some of these methods felt unnecessary
