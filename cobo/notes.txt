Record the method signature in the space below.
A:   public static double sentimentVal( String word )

Does this method require a parameter? If so, what type of parameter is required?
What happens if you pass a different type of parameter instead? (Try it!)
A: It requires a parameter of type String. if we try to pass a different type of parameter, the terminal returns the error invalid type.

Does the method return a value? If so, what is the return type?
A: Yes, it returns a double.

3a. double num = sentimentVal("warm");
A: will compile, because sentimentVal returns a double, and takes one string parameter.

3b. String word = sentimentval(0.5);
A: Will not compile, because sentimentval does not return a string, and does not take a double parameter.

3c. Double x = sentimentVal("good", "bad");
A: Will not compile, because sentimentVal only takes one parameter.

Activity 2

4. In totalSentiment, we utilized texttostring to convert a text file into strings. We then put this string into an array using the split function. We created a for loop to iterate through all the strings and added their sentiment values to our final answer.

5a. Some aspects do not make sense, for example if a person left one 4 star review, the output would still return a one.

5b. One adjustment would be to use the average stars instead of just adding them all together, this would reduce the bias towards more, bad reviews over less, good reviews. Another would be to change the return type to double in order to get a more accurate result.

6. The student's code does not contain an if statement for when stars are greater than 15. This means that any star value above 15 would return zero. He could fix this problem by making his if statements go up from zero instead of down to.

Activity 3

3. Indexof returns the index, or position in the array, of the chosen element. substring returns a portion of a String, within the chosen start and end indexes. You have to add one because the start index is inclusive, and if one was not added would also include the last element of the portion of the string not selected.

5. Static methods can be called directly from the main method. Nonstatic methods require an instance of themselves to be created before they can be called.

6. To do this, we can alter fakeReview to take randomPostiveAdjective() or randomNegativeAdjective() instead of randomAdjective().

Activity 4

1. If we wanted to harm the restaurant's reputation and/or were short sellers.

2. If we had stock in the restaurant and wanted its value to go up.

3. We would alter the method to take more extreme reviews. If we wanted a negative review, we could restrict the method to only use adjectives with a sentiment value of less than -1, or for a positive review a value of more than 1.

5. oneWord's value would be the original String, from the first index to the last.

6. The * character would prevent the adjective from being recognized.

7. We could modify the method to only take values with a sentiment value of more than 1.
