* hashmap is java equivalent to the python dictionaries you know and love
* nothing else should seem too unfamiliar to a Thinker

Summary of work:
With the consumer review lab, our first and really only major hurdle was getting the total Sentiment value to work. Due to the nature of strings and the inability to concatenate them, it was very difficult to decide when to splice and how to count it as part of the whole. We ended up using a split method which we found in the java API. With the split method, we were able to read each word as separate, allowing for an easier time. The split method also became handy when working on the positive/negative reviews. Overall, the lab felt more like a review than anything; as a group, we all understood what was happening and felt that the work was very cutthroat and copy-paste, which almost goes against what CS is all about.
